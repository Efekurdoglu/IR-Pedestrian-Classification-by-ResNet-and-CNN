# IR Pedestrian Classification by ResNet and CNN

## Introduction 
* This project shows how to classify pedestrians using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a deep residual network (DRN). There are 81592 infrared pedestrian and non-pedestrian pictures in this dataset. Datasets are scaled as a pre-processing step. For each method, the value should be between 0-255 and transformed to uint8 data type. For the extraction of features and
Convolutional neural networks, deep residual networks, and classification portions are all employed. DRN has a better level of precision than CNN. The categorization accuracy of CNN and DRN is 89 percent and 89 percent, respectively. 95% and 95%, respectively. Finally, in the conclusion section, observations and future work plans are completed.
